## 1. Node.js Video Processing Script

Write a Node.js script that accepts 3 command line arguments: an input filename of an MP4 video, a start timestamp, and an end timestamp in seconds. The
script should generate a GIF from the video segment between these timestamps, applying a watermark of the Edge Video logo at the bottom right corner of
the GIF. The process should be optimized for speed and minimal memory usage. Consider edge cases such as invalid timestamps or files.

Include error handling for various edge cases and document your approach to optimizing the GIF creation process.

## 2. Blockchain Data Interaction

Develop a Node.js application that connects to the Polygon mainnet to fetch transaction histories of the Edge Activity Token holders. Your script should
analyze these transactions to identify and display the top 5 most active wallets, excluding the contract creator, by transaction count. Summarize the
data in a human-readable format, considering both incoming and outgoing transactions.

Discuss your methodology for filtering and analyzing transaction data, as well as any libraries or frameworks utilized.

## 3. Browser-Based Data Visualization

Create a browser-based application that visualizes the distribution of Edge Activity Token holders on the Polygon mainnet. Your application should
dynamically fetch data, process it, and display it on a web-based interactive map, showcasing the geographical distribution of token holders. Utilize
canvas or SVG for rendering the map.

Explain your approach to correlating wallet addresses with geographical data and your choice of libraries for rendering the map.

## 4. React, PostgreSQL, and Cloud Services Integration Challenge (Thought Exercise)

Design a system architecture for a scalable, real-time chat application using React for the frontend, PostgreSQL for database management, and AWS or
Azure for cloud services. Your design should include:

- User authentication and data security measures.
- Real-time message exchange and storage strategies.
- Scalability solutions for growing numbers of users and messages.
- Integration of a feature that allows users to send cryptocurrency tips to each other, leveraging blockchain technology.

Provide a detailed discussion on how you would approach user authentication, data security, real-time communication, and the integration of blockchain technology for the tipping feature. Include considerations for choosing specific AWS or Azure services to support these functionalities.
